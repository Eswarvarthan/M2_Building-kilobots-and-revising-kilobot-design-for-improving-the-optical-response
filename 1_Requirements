BUILDING KILOBOTS AND REVISING KILOBOT DESIGN FOR IMPROVING THE OPTICAL RESPONSE
Objectives
Kilobot is one of the commonly used robots for swarm robotics tests and developments.
Purchasing Kilobots is expensive and it does not give the students a solid experience to
understand the Kilobot hardware. In-house building and debugging can help students understand
the operations and discover some aspects that they can work with for further development. The
main goal of this research is to build and revise Kilobot in-house to support swarm robotics
experiments. The main objectives of this research include the following:
• Create guidelines on building and debugging Kilobot in-house based on our building
experience.
• Update the design to allow a more flexible experiment environment than before.
• Verify the performance of Kilobot that we built in relevant experiments.
• Increase the number of Kilobots
