ABSTRACT
Inspired by the emergent behavior of swarms, we want to eventually use a distributed selforganizing swarm of robots for shape formation. To verify the idea using real robots in the experiment, we need to first build more Kilobots to enlarge our repository of Kilobots. Kilobot is a kind of small robot with a 33-mm diameter that was originally designed by Harvard in 2012 and redesigned at WCU with the simplified building process in 2016 (WCU Kilobot version 1.1).
Based on the earlier design, we have redesigned the Kilobots further (with three revisions in version 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4). This research work describes the challenges and solutions in building and debugging Kilobots, as well as the planned shape formation operation. Kilobots are built inhouse using reflow soldering for surface mount components and hand soldering for through-hole components. A systematic debugging procedure, as well as the most commonly seen issues and their solutions, are described based on our building and testing experience. The WCU Kilobot version 1.1 was designed in PADS, and yet we no longer had the license in PADS. Therefore, we redid the schematics and PCB layout in Altium Designer, and enlarged the spacing between the crowded components, in WCU Kilobot version 1.2. Although the design of version 1.2 was nearly the same as in version 1.1 with only added spacing, it was redone in Altium Designer that we could continue to maintain a license, and hence our later revisions were possible.
